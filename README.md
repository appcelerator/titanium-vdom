# Titanium Virtual DOM

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/appcelerator/titanium-vdom/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/appcelerator/titanium-vdom?branch=master) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/appcelerator/titanium-vdom.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Virtual DOM abstraction which serves as the connecting piece to integrate Angular and Vue.js with Titanium.

## Development guide

This project uses an expiremental unit testing setup using the new [titanium-karma-runner](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium-karma-runner). To run unit tests spin up the Karma server using `npm run test:unit`. Now run the titanium-karma-runner app on an iOS simulator or Android emulator and the tests will be run inside that app. Results will be shown in the app itself and coverage data gets written to the `coverage` directory.

For a rapid TDD setup you can use `npm run test:unit-dev` and Karma will watch for any changes to the source and test files and schedule a new test run everytime. No coverage data will be written in this configuration.
